# Cancer-detection-using-ml-project
Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide. Early detection is crucial in improving 
survival rates, yet traditional diagnostic methods often face challenges in accuracy and accessibility. 
This project explores the application of machine learning techniques to enhance the detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. By 
leveraging advanced algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), the study aims to 
improve the accuracy of early diagnosis, reduce false positives and negatives, and offer a cost-effective solution that can be integrated 
into existing healthcare systems.
 The results demonstrate a significant improvement in diagnostic performance, highlighting the potential of machine learning in 
transforming breast cancer detection and ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes.
